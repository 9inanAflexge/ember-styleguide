# Typography

### Usage

#### Legibility

Text legibility is primarily affected by color. All text on the website should comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) Level AA requirements.

Please refer to the <a href="colours">Colors</a> section for more information on color contrast and accessibility.

### Sizes

Use `.small` for small headings or notice paragraphs.

```html
<div class="small">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

Use `.base` for body text, navigation items or links.

```html
<div class="base">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

`.base` is also the default paragraph size.

```html
<div>
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

Use `.medium` for section headings. This is also the default size for the `h3` element.

```html
<div class="medium">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

Use `.large` for content page headings. This is also the default size for the `h2` element.

```html
<div class="large">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

Use `.xlarge` for landing page headlines. This is also the default size for the `h1` element.

```html
<div class="xlarge">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

Use `.display` in page headers.

```html
<div class="display">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

## Weights

Use `.regular`

```html
<div class="medium regular">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

Use `.bold` if you must style something as bold and no semantic information needs to be carried. Prefer using `<strong>`.

```html
<div class="medium bold">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```
