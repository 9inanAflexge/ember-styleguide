# Typography

### Usage

#### Legibility

Text legibility is primarily affected by color. All text on the website should comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) Level AA requirements.

Please refer to the <a href="colours">Colors</a> section for more information on color contrast and accessibility.

### Sizes

Use `.text-sm` for small headings or notice paragraphs.

```html
<div class="text-sm">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

Use `.text-base` for body text, navigation items or links.

```html
<div class="text-base">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

`.text-base` is also the default paragraph size.

```html
<div>
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

Use `.text-md` for section headings. This is also the default size for the `h3` element.

```html
<div class="text-md">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

Use `.large` for content page headings. This is also the default size for the `h2` element.

```html
<div class="text-lg">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

Use `.xlarge` for landing page headlines. This is also the default size for the `h1` element.

```html
<div class="text-xl">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

Use `.display` in page headers.

```html
<div class="display">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

## Weights

Use `.regular`

```html
<div class="text-md regular">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```

Use `.bold` if you must style something as bold and no semantic information needs to be carried. Prefer using `<strong>`.

```html
<div class="text-md bold">
  Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
</div>
```
